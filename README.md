# Matrix_oop

Implementation of a proprietary library for processing numerical matrices in the C++ (version 17) programming language using the object-oriented approach. The object-oriented approach allows to implement a library for matrices as a separate class whose objects have defined operations, that can be represented both as methods and as standard operators +, -, *, etc.

## Information

### An example of a matrix class in C++
```cpp
class S21Matrix {
    private:
        // Attributes
        int _rows, _cols;         // Rows and columns
        double **_matrix;         // Pointer to the memory where the matrix is allocated

    public:
        S21Matrix();              // Default constructor
        ~S21Matrix();             // Destructor

        void sum_matrix(const S21Matrix& other); 
        // Other methods..
}
```

### A reminder of the matrix basics

Matrix is a rectangular table of numbers arranged in m rows and n columns

```
    1 2 3
A = 4 5 6
    7 8 9
```

```
     1  2  3  4
В =  5  6  7  8
     9 10 11 12
```

You can get the desired element using indices as follows A[1,1] = 1, where the first index is the row number, the second is the column number.

The order of a matrix is the number of its rows or columns. \
The main diagonal of a square matrix is the diagonal from the upper left to the lower right corner. \

A rectangular matrix (B) is a matrix with the number of rows not equal to the number of columns. \
A square matrix (A) is a matrix with the number of rows equal to the number of columns.

## Matrix operations

There is a brief description of the matrix operations below that need to be implemented in the developing library.
They are similar to the operations you performed earlier in «structured programming», so you can see a more detailed description of them there.
Note that some operations have exceptional situations that require special handling using the exception mechanism.

| Operation | Description | Exceptional situations |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| `bool eq_matrix(const S21Matrix& other)` | Checks matrices for equality with each other |  |
| `void sum_matrix(const S21Matrix& other)` | Adds the second matrix to the current one | different matrix dimensions |
| `void sub_matrix(const S21Matrix& other)` | Subtracts another matrix from the current one | different matrix dimensions |
| `void mul_number(const double num) ` | Multiplies the current matrix by a number |  |
| `void mul_matrix(const S21Matrix& other)` | Multiplies the current matrix by the second matrix | the number of columns of the first matrix is not equal to the number of rows of the second matrix |
| `S21Matrix transpose()` | Creates a new transposed matrix from the current one and returns it |  |
| `S21Matrix calc_complements()` | Calculates the algebraic addition matrix of the current one and returns it | the matrix is not square |
| `double determinant()` | Calculates and returns the determinant of the current matrix | the matrix is not square |
| `S21Matrix inverse_matrix()` | Calculates and returns the inverse matrix | matrix determinant is 0 |

Apart from those operations, you also need to implement constructors and destructors:

| Method | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| `S21Matrix()` | A basic constructor that initialises a matrix of some predefined dimension |  
| `S21Matrix(int rows, int cols) ` | Parametrized constructor with number of rows and columns |
| `S21Matrix(const S21Matrix& other)` | Copy constructor |
| `S21Matrix(S21Matrix&& other)` | Move constructor |
| `~S21Matrix()` | Destructor |

And you also need to overload the following operators, partly corresponding to the operations above:

| Operator | Description | Exceptional situations |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| `+`      | Addition of two matrices | different matrix dimensions |
| `-`   | Subtraction of one matrix from another | different matrix dimensions |
| `*`  | Matrix multiplication and matrix multiplication by a number | the number of columns of the first matrix does not equal the number of rows of the second matrix |
| `==`  | Checks for matrices equality (`eq_matrix`) | |
| `=`  | Assignment of values from one matrix to another one | |
| `+=`  | Addition assignment (`sum_matrix`) | different matrix dimensions |
| `-=`  | Difference assignment (`sub_matrix`) | different matrix dimensions |
| `*=`  | Multiplication assignment (`mul_matrix`/`mul_number`) | the number of columns of the first matrix does not equal the number of rows of the second matrix |
| `(int i, int j)`  | Indexation by matrix elements (row, column) | index is outside the matrix |

## Implementation of the matrix_oop.h library functions

- For start of build and tests program use `make` in terminal
- The program developed in C++ language of C++17 standard using gcc compiler
- Implemention of the matrix as an `S21Matrix` class
- Used only the `matrix`, `rows` and `columns` fields as private
- Implemention of the access to private fields `rows` and `columns` via accessor and mutator
- This is static library (with matrix_oop.h header file)
- Implemention of the operations described [above](#matrix-operations)
- Overloading the operators according to the table in the chapter [above](#matrix-operations)
- Prepared full coverage of library functions code with unit-tests using the GTest library
- Provided a Makefile for building the library and tests (with targets all, clean, test, matrix_oop.a)
- The program has only been tested on a Mac.
